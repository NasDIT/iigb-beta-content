Crossrail is Europe’s largest ever construction project, worth £14.5 billion. By 2019, it will add more direct connections from the South East to London and cut journey times.


Other projects include a western rail link to London Heathrow airport, a major renovation of Reading station and work on a high speed London to Birmingham rail link.
