The UK has an open and fair procedure for buying products and services from businesses. 

All bids to provide products or services are subject to the Information Act 2000, which means that you can request details of the bidding process and feedback if your bid is unsuccessful. Information from your bid can be disclosed to anyone who asks for it under the Freedom of Information Act, unless you have a non-disclosure agreement in place.
