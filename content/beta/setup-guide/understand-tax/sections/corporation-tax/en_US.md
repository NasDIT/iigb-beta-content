### Corporation Tax

Any foreign company with a UK branch or office must pay UK Corporation Tax. The [current corporation tax rate is 20%](https://www.gov.uk/corporation-tax-rates/rates), reducing to 17% by 2020. At the current rate of 20%, the UK has the lowest headline business tax rate in the G7, and joint lowest in the G20. 

### Employment tax

[National Insurance](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance/overview) must be paid for(or in respect of) all employees. Employers pay 13.8% in addition to the 12% payable by employees for earnings over 112 GBP per week. 


### Tax on sales

Value Added Tax (VAT) must be charged and paid on goods and services. UK VAT is charged at 20%, although [there are some exceptions.](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rates-of-vat-on-different-goods-and-services) UK businesses that sell goods or services charge VAT on sales and customers who are themselves registered for VAT will be able to recover VAT paid out.  

VAT is not applied to most export transactions, although it is likely to apply to sales to non-VAT registered businesses and private individuals within other EU countries. Imports into the UK (and other EU countries) from non-EU countries will have an import duty charge to pay on goods but not services.
