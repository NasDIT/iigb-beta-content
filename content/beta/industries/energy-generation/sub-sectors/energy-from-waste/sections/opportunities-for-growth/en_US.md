title: Opportunities for growth

With the size of our waste energy market, there are options available to grow your business. From our use of conventional incineration to advanced technologies, you can expand into new markets  covering the broad range of waste energy available here. 

The market includes a variety of waste streams:

- municipal waste - mixed waste from either domestic premises or business  
- organic feedstock – such as food waste and green waste from gardens and parks
- commercial and industrial waste from a range of activities
- construction and demolition waste including waste wood used at biomass facilities

The next generation of waste energy will be powered by experimental technologies that produce biofuels for vehicles from organic and plastic waste.

Businesses based in the UK are developing these innovative new sources for biofuels, helping to cement our place as a fantastic base for international operations. 

There’s also an estimated £1 billion pipeline opportunity for community heating projects in the UK, which could be fulfilled by waste to energy and biomass projects.
