In 2015, the UK government introduced a £1.3 billion package of tax measures for the oil and gas industry, to ensure that the UK Continental Shelf remains an attractive destination for investment. 

The government also committed £20m in new funding for the second round of seismic surveys to support new exploration activity on the UK Continental Shelf.  This will give companies a greater chance of discovering opportunities without having to fund the surveys themselves.
