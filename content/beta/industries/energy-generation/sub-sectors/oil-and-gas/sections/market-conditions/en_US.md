## The UK has over 100 years in the oil and gas industry 


There are over 380 fields producing oil and gas in the UK today. That’s resulted in 43 billion barrels of oil being recovered from the UK Continental Shelf, with estimates stating that 22 billion barrels of recoverable reserves remain. 


The UK’s potential doesn’t stop there. New opportunities, like decommissioning, are opening up for companies too. 


## Market conditions

With over 100 years experience, businesses can be sure that they’re entering a market that’s widely acknowledged as a global leader.


We are well placed to investigate new technologies and innovations. The UK is now focusing on technically challenging methods of extraction and production, including:


heavy oil
high-pressure, high-temperature extraction
enhanced oil recovery
special materials for sealing systems


## Safe development of shale gas
Onshore, the UK government is backing the safe development of shale gas because it’s good for jobs, energy security and the UK’s plans to decarbonise the economy. 


According to a report published by Ernst & Young in 2014, investment in shale could reach £33 billion and support 64,000 jobs.


The British Geological Survey has  identified areas with potentially large reserves of shale gas and oil. UK geology is promising, but we make no assumptions about production levels. We need exploration to determine the potential.
 
Our current priority is investment in new gas plants with new build, storage and distribution opportunities. Our switch from coal to gas will require storage and distribution network upgrades.
