title: "A world class regulatory system"
---

At the heart of our nuclear programme is a world-class independent regulatory system. The[ Office for Nuclear Regulation](http://www.onr.org.uk/) and the [Environment Agency ](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency)work together to make sure that any new nuclear power stations built here meet high standards of safety, security, environmental protection and waste management. This process is called the [Generic Design Assessment](http://www.onr.org.uk/new-reactors/) (GDA).

Businesses that achieve GDA approval in the UK are recognised as meeting the most rigorous standards in the nuclear industry, providing them with a stepping-stone for further international growth.
