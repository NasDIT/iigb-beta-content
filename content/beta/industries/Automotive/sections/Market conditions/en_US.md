UK car production is rising sharply. Between 2009 and 2020, it will double to 2 million.

Our car manufacturers are committed to increasing the local content of their cars. This provides huge opportunities for component suppliers.

The UK vehicle manufacturing industry is extremely diverse. It includes 8 volume car factories, 5 commercial vehicle/bus factories and the world’s biggest specialist car sector with iconic brands from Aston Martin to Rolls Royce.

Our automotive sector is truly global; 18 of the world’s top 20 suppliers to the automotive industry have operations here, and we export 77% of UK-made cars to over 100 countries.
