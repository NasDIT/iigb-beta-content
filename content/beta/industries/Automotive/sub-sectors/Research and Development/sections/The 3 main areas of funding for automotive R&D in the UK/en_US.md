title: "The 3 main areas of funding for automotive R&D in the UK"

**Low carbon propulsion**

The UK is already a global powertrain centre, manufacturing over 2.5 million petrol and diesel engines a year. We’re now leading the move into electrified powertrains, whether that be hybrids, battery electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cells. Government and UK car industry has agreed to jointly invest an unprecedented £1 billion over 10 years developing low carbon propulsion systems. This is administered via the Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC). APC run 2 competitions per year for companies seeking up to 50% funding for projects that will lead to a reduction in the carbon emissions of road vehicles.

**Lightweighting**

The UK has an unmatched track-record in the development of lightweight materials, from the first carbon fibre used in Formula One by McLaren in 1981 to the current model range of Jaguar Land Rover, the world’s most aluminium-intensive car manufacturer. One of the most significant materials for the future of road cars is carbon fibre composites. This presents an opportunity to take the UK’s leading position in motorsport and aerospace and apply it to the emerging market for mass-produced carbon fibre for car production. This is being assisted by the High Value Manufacturing Catapult, a world-leading network of facilities where composites companies can take advantage of the latest test and development machinery.

**Connected and Autonomous vehicles (CAVs)**

The UK is determined to be a leader in the field of CAVs. To that end, it has created a £200 million fund administered by the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV). Like the APC, it is jointly funded by industry and government, and offers grants via a regular competitive bidding process.

The UK has huge advantages in CAV technology. According to Eurostat, 40% of all large European software companies are based in the UK. With a history of early adoption of technology from home PCs to Internet shopping, the UK has all the right building blocks to develop CAVs.

We’re also establishing ourselves as a leading destination for CAV development, with the world’s most progressive regulatory regime. Testing is possible on any of our roads with the following simple provisos:

- test vehicles must be roadworthy;

- a suitably trained driver or operator (who does not need to be in the vehicle) must be able to take control; and

- appropriate insurance must be in place.
