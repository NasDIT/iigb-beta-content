Firms that supply motorsport operate throughout, Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The largest concentration of motorsport firms are located in 'Motorsport Valley®', a world-renowned business cluster in the south east England with Oxford at its centre. Professor Michael Porter, a Harvard University and founder of Monitor Deloitte, has described it as, “_A mature economic business cluster, which is number one in the world…the jewel in the crown of British engineering._”

In the 50 years since the modern Formula One era began with the 3.0 litre engines in 1967, only 2 teams have won the Constructors Championship with a car designed outside the UK, and one of those used a British engine.

The Formula One teams with headquarters here are:
- Red Bull Racing in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire

- McLaren Honda in Woking, Surrey

- Mercedes AMG Petronas in Brackley, Northamptonshire

- Renault Sport in Enstone, Oxfordshire

- Williams Martini Racing in Grove, Oxfordshire

- Force India in Silverstone, Northamptonshire

- Manor Racing in Banbury, Oxfordshire


Formula One Research and Development centres
- Haas in Banbury, Oxfordshire

- Toro Rosso in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire

**From race to road**

For over 50 years the UK has been responsible for more motorsport innovations than any other country, many of which have found their way onto road cars. These include:

- 1950s, disc brakes produced by Jaguar

- 1960s, 4 valves per cylinder engines produced by Cosworth

- 1970s, ground-effect aerodynamics produced by Lotus

- 1980s, composites produced by McLaren

- 1990s, active chassis with traction control and driver aids produced by Williams

- 2000s, Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems also by Williams


**Pioneering technology beyond Formula One**

The UK provides a base for Formula E, the new global electric racing series, and is a major international supplier to IndyCar and NASCAR in the USA, the China Touring Car Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans series.

Other racing series benefit from new technology developed by UK companies. For example, Cosworth, based in Northampton, is a global leader in engine electronics and telemetry (and now supplies data logging and telemetry for the road-going Chevrolet Corvette) while Berkshire’s Xtrac is world-renowned for the design and manufacture of transmission systems.

UK motorsport companies are also going beyond racing into sectors such as energy storage, marine and defence. For example, Williams Advanced Engineering has installed flywheel energy storage technology in two remote Scottish island communities, and Wildcat Automotive has transformed its Wildcat 500DKR off-road racer into a specialist military all-terrain vehicle.

Some are even going beyond physical engineering: McLaren has applied pit-stop techniques to reduce waiting times and increase operating theatre efficiency at Great Ormond Street Hospital.
