title: Support and incentives 
---
The UK has lower operating costs than you might expect and high after-tax profitability for medical businesses. With many new incentives in place, businesses can build more cost-effectively from a solid foundation, rather than from the ground up.

## Funding for business growth

The UK government has dedicated funding for life sciences, including medical manufacture. From research and development to academic collaboration, thereâ€™s a variety of funding options available depending on what your business specialises in. 

## Investment in medical manufacturing 

The UK government has made significant investments in national infrastructure, research and training to support medical manufacturers.

These schemes have launched the National Biologics Manufacturing Centre (for bioprocessing and vaccine technology). These significant public infrastructure investments have created the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult and a new Cell and Gene Therapy Manufacturing Centre.

As a result, the UK is now a leading nation in the development of cutting-edge technologies for stem cells and cell culture, synthetic biology and gene-editing.
