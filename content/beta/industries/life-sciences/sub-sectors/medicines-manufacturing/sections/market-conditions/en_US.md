## Creating tomorrow’s medicines
The UK has a long and successful track record in pharmaceutical manufacturing. There’s a strong drive to develop manufacturing for the health and life sciences technologies of the future, such as advanced therapies, digital design or near-patient manufacturing. Whether you’re looking to make tomorrow’s medicines or next generation medical technologies and healthcare products, your company will thrive here.

## A highly advanced sector
There are around 1,300 companies involved in pharmaceutical manufacturing in the UK. Health and life sciences manufacturing accounts for nearly 10% (gross value added) of all UK manufacturing.
The pharmaceuticals sector alone conducts more UK-based business research and development than any other manufacturing sector, making up more than 20% of all business research and development in the UK.

## Robust regulation with high standards and low risk
Businesses which set up or invest in the UK benefit from a low-risk manufacturing environment. Our industry offers a highly respected regulatory framework with robust compliance and quality assurance culture at every level. This means there are fewer chances of product recalls.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is a supportive and pragmatic regulator. Its [Innovation Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/mhra-innovation-office) helps businesses clarify product regulatory or manufacturing requirements and can find faster routes to market.
MHRA has global impact as a regulatory agency and in setting international standards. The agency’s National Institute for Biological Standards and Control produces more than 90% of the international standards for biological medicines.

## Health and life sciences skills and expertise
The UK has a highly skilled workforce with more than 107,000 employees in the biopharmaceutical sector and a total workforce of 222,000 across the whole of health and life sciences.

Pharmaceutical manufacturing expertise is spread throughout the nation with a very strong base in the ‘golden triangle’ of London, Oxford and Cambridge. The sector supports innovative manufacturing processes, technologies and training, giving companies a significant skills base to deliver in a very knowledge-intensive industry.
 
Our skills and expertise are major reasons why all of the leading pharmaceutical corporations operating in the global market have a presence in the UK. Two of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies (GSK and AstraZeneca) also have their headquarters here.
