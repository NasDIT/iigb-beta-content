The UK also offers access to innovative researchers in engineering, physical, social, medical, and digital sciences. 

## Organisations that provide support

[Innovate UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk) stimulates technology-enabled innovation. Their Knowledge Transfer Partnership can help businesses develop collaborative partnerships with the UK’s world-class universities, colleges and research organisations. 

Rapid prototyping through the High-Value Manufacturing Catapult can help businesses work with leading scientists and engineers to transform manufacturing ideas into valuable products and services.

The [National Institute for Health Research](http://www.nihr.ac.uk/) (NIHR) Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure helps businesses demonstrate the clinical performance of medical technology without delay.  

The [NIHR Clinical Research Network](http://www.nihr.ac.uk/industry/about-the-nihr-clinical-research-network.htm) (CRN) supports set-up and delivery of medical technology research studies across a range of disease and clinical areas, such as diabetes and orthopaedics.

The [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency) (MHRA) helps to simplify the regulatory process. They provide a decentralised approval system that follows the European Medical Devices Directive. 

Through CE marking, MHRA must process clinical investigations in 60 days but is often able to achieve this earlier and get products to patients 2 to 3 years ahead of the USA and 5 years ahead of Japan. 

MHRA’s dedicated Innovation Office helps organisations developing innovative medicines, medical devices or novel manufacturing processes to navigate the regulatory processes. 

Additional support comes from the [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence](https://www.nice.org.uk/) (NICE). They produce independent, authoritative and evidence-based guidance on the most efficient ways to prevent, diagnose and treat disease and ill health. 

NICE also has a Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme which identifies medical technologies that have the potential to offer substantial benefit to patients. Medical technologies are likely to be adopted consistently and rapidly if NICE develops guidance on them.
