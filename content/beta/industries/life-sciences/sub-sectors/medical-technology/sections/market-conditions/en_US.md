There are over 3,500 companies in the UK’s medical technology sector, 98% of which are small to medium sized enterprises. They produce a vast range of medical devices and diagnostic technologies. About one-third of these companies have significant research and development and manufacturing activity in the UK.

As an investor you’ll have access to clinicians, patients and organisations at multiple points in the research development and manufacturing processes of technology. You’ll also have plenty of opportunities to engage with academics, designers, regulators and manufacturers.

Our service commissioners have an in-depth understanding of patient care pathways and offer an outcomes-focused approach that delivers quality and cost-effectiveness. 

Designing, developing, testing and selling your medical technology in the UK will give your concept the chance to benefit from this same approach.
