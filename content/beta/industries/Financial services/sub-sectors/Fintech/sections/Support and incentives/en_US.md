### Strong regulatory and tax support
 
The UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), supports the industry. The FCA  helps to maintain market stability and ensures transparency. It’s world renowned for its support for the industry, and its accessibility.
 
The FCA supports disruptive technologies, and has stated it’s sympathetic to companies developing new business models outside of current regulation.
 
The UK government, to promote competition and innovation, also provides a number of highly effective tax incentives and programmes.

They include:

- the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS)
- the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS)
- Entrepreneurs’ Relief (ER)
- Research and Development tax credits
- the Patent Box scheme which allows companies pay a lower rate of Corporation Tax on profits earned from their patented innovations
