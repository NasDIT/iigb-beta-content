### Fresh talent, entrepreneurial excellence

The availability of talent in the UK is currently stronger than in most other FinTech regions. London is a world leader for financial and entrepreneurial talent, but there are other clusters of digital excellence throughout the UK.
 
The UK FinTech sector employs about 61,000 people. Thatâ€™s more than New York or the combined workforce of Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia.
 
We have a world-class higher education system, which supplies the sector with finance, engineering and design talent.
