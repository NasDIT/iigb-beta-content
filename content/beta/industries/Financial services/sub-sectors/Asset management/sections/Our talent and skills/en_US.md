### A large talent pool

The UK's highly developed financial services support infrastructure allows companies to hire staff efficiently, and cost effectively. Currently, the asset management sector in the UK employs over 90,000 people.

### Attractive business environment with regional strengths

London is central to the UK’s strong international position. Respondents to The Banker’s Global Asset Management Survey city have voted it the most attractive global location for relocating or expanding asset management operations, ahead of Hong Kong, Singapore and New York.
 
Important centres for fund management can also be found further afield. Areas such as Edinburgh, Manchester, Cardiff and Birmingham are well known as bases for companies with expertise in fund management.
