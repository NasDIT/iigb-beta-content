### A growing, open market

The UK is one of the most open markets for fund management, and has had 7 successive years of growth. Total assets under management increased to a record £6.9 trillion at the end of 2015.
 
Overseas investors own about 40% of medium sized fund management firms. Asset managers with overseas parent organisations manage 57% of assets managed in the UK according to the Investment Association.
 
More assets are managed in the UK than in the next three leading European countries put together, second only to the US.
 
The UK is an important location for fund domicile. Around 12% of European assets under management were domiciled in the UK at the end of 2014. The largest asset holders according to City UK are:
- Luxembourg (27%)
