### Regulatory and government support

The UK has a regulatory system thatâ€™s fair, effective and principled.

We also have one of the most competitive tax regimes in the world for both funds and asset managers. Funds that are domiciled in the UK can take advantage of around 120 double taxation agreements, more than in any other country.

UK government has the ambition for us to lead the world in investment management and has demonstrated a strong commitment to the sector. In 2013, it implemented the Investment Management Strategy, which is focused on improving the UK's taxation regime, improving the regulatory environment, reducing fund authorisation times, and representing the UK globally through effective marketing.
