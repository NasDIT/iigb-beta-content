### Strong support from government

In 2015, the government introduced a £1.3bn package of tax measures for the oil and gas industry, to ensure that the UK Continental Shelf remains an attractive destination for investment. 

In March 2016, it also provided a further £1bn package of fiscal measures to support the industry through the challenging commercial conditions it’s facing.  

Additionally, the government has committed to £20m of new funding for the second round of seismic surveys. This will support new exploration activity on the UK Continental Shelf, giving companies a greater chance of discovering opportunities without having to fund the surveys themselves.
