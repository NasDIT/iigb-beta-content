### An industry underpinned by talent

Our technologies are at the forefront of utilisation, safety, and the environmental sector. This has resulted in a large, highly developed and flexible workforce. 

Over 350,000 people are employed by the oil and gas industry in the UK. That includes over 50,000 experts in subsea production, who have pioneered deep-sea exploration and extraction. 

Our education sector is also closely aligned with oil and gas. All levels of training are provided, ensuring present and future generations of our workforce are highly skilled. This includes technical and vocational skills, as well as undergraduate and postgraduate studies and research.
