### The perfect partnership of expertise and innovation

We have over 100 years experience in the oil and gas industry. With so much expertise, businesses can be sure that they’re entering a market that’s widely acknowledged as a global leader

From this position of authority, we are well placed to investigate new technologies and innovations. The UK is now focusing on technically challenging methods of extraction and production, including:
- heavy oil
- high-pressure, high-temperature extraction
- enhanced oil recovery
- special materials for sealing systems

Onshore, the UK government is backing the safe development of shale gas because it’s good for jobs, energy security and the UK’s plans to decarbonise the economy. 

According to a report published by Ernst & Young in 2014, investment in shale could reach £33 billion and support 64,000 jobs.

The British Geological Survey identified areas with potentially large reserves of shale gas and oil. UK geology is promising, but we make no assumptions about production levels. We need exploration to determine the potential.
 
Our current priority is the investment in new gas plants with the new build, storage, and distribution opportunities. Our switch from coal to gas will require storage and distribution network upgrades.
