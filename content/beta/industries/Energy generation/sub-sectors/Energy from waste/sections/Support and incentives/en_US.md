The UK has funding options to assist companies that want to develop sustainable energy facilities. These sources of funding change regularly to meet market demand and are dependent on the type of project and your location within the UK.

Incentives are available through bidding for Contracts for Difference, which gives greater certainty and stability of revenues to electricity generators. 

There’s support available for growing logistics and sourcing quality components from bins and turbines to compactors and shredders.
