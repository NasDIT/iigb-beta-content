With the positive transformation taking place in our nuclear industry, the prospects for businesses to establish themselves in the UK supply chain are vast. 

We have major infrastructure projects across 17 sites, that include: 
- new build opportunities
- decommissioning
- waste management programmes

This means that businesses can build long-term, high impact relationships that generate a strong return on investment.

Potentially, there are huge benefits for overseas investors working in partnership with UK companies.  Strong relationships built in the UK are likely to translate into global opportunities.
