The UK’s automotive supply chain is currently enjoying a period of unprecedented growth. In 2015, our automotive manufacturers spent £31 billion on components and that is growing by £3 billion per year.

With growing demand for British-made vehicles, automotive production will exceed 2 million cars by 2020. This creates huge opportunities for businesses involved in all parts of the supply chain.
