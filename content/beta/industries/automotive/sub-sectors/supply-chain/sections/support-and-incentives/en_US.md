All these areas have dedicated bodies which assist and promote their local automotive industry.

In the Midlands, [Drive West Midland](http://www.drivewestmidlands.co.uk/) is a pioneering programme that supports the development of small or medium sized enterprises and coordinates local support services for the automotive sector. 

Further north, there is the [Northern Automotive Alliance](http://northernautoalliance.com/) and the [North East Automotive Alliance](https://www.northeastautomotivealliance.com/) Both organisations provide support to companies setting up in the region, as well as to the industry at large.
