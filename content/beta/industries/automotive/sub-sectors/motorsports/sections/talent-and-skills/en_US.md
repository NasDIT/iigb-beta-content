title: Our talent and skills
---

The UK is home to 7 of the 11 Formula One motor racing teams. McLaren, Williams and Mercedes-Benz have all made the UK their HQ. 

We have world-class universities. According to the QS World University Rankings, 4 of the world’s top 10 universities and 9 of the top 10 EU universities are in the UK.

We have leading engineering companies like Ricardo and world-class automotive research facilities thanks to the recently established Catapult network (hyperlink to R&D page).

We’re also leading the move to low carbon propulsion. Europe’s only large-scale battery facility for electric cars is here. We currently account for over 20% of European electric vehicle production.
