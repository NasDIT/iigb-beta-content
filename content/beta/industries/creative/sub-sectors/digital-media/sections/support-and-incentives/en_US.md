**Support for investment**

Government is fully committed to supporting the UK as a leading digital nation. 

Our help for early stage innovation and research and development is second to none.  You can take advantage of a number of tax incentives to develop and innovate here:
 
- Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme – a model for tax efficient investment at the seed and angel phase which is attracting new investors into the technology and start up environment
- Research and development tax credits – small and medium sized companies can write research and development investment off against tax to a rate of 230%
- The Patent Box enables companies to apply a lower rate of Corporation Tax to profits earned from its patented inventions

The government has invested more than £200 million in a network of Technology and Innovation Centres supporting the commercialisation of new technologies by business. Innovate UK, the UK’s innovation support agency, invests in research and development related to strategic sector development targets.

We also offer a number of world-class digital start-up programmes and opportunities for angel investment. 

All of these measure complement our low level of corporation tax, set to drop to 17% by 2020.
