**Support for investment**

Government is fully committed to supporting the UK as a leading digital nation. 

Our help for early stage innovation and R&D is second to none.  You can take advantage of a number of tax incentives to develop and innovate here:
 
- Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme – a model for tax efficient investment at the seed and angel phase which is attracting new investors into the technology and start up environment
- R&D tax credits – small and medium sized companies can write R&D investment off against tax to a rate of 230%
- The Patent Box enables companies to apply a lower rate of Corporation Tax to profits earned from its patented inventions

The government has invested more than £200 million in a network of Technology and Innovation Centres supporting the commercialisation of new technologies by business. Innovate UK, the UK’s innovation support agency, invests in R&D related to strategic sector development targets.

We also offer a number of world-class digital start-up programmes and opportunities for angel investment. 

All of these measure complement our low level of corporation tax, set to drop to 17% by 2020.
