By 2017, 95% of UK homes and businesses will have access to superfast broadband. Current coverage is already higher than France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

### Strong areas of opportunity 

**Creative disruption is driving digital advertising**

The size of the UK digital advertising market was £7.2 billion in 2014. Mobile advertising increased to £1.6 billion; that's up 63% on the year. 

Delivering targeted and effective advertising has also generated new business segments which are thriving here. That means many new opportunities for market entrants in areas such as  programmatic trading, native advertising and analytics.

**Personalisation is boosting mobile**

The UK is Europe’s largest mobile content market, with over £1 billion spent on mobile applications, content and services each year, and the highest mobile advertising spend per head.  Our e-commerce market was worth £104 billion in 2014. 

Mobile in the UK has been boosted by our strong leadership in personalisation of platforms and content, an increase in smartphones and choice of mobile contracts, and a strong games and advertising industry. This is all supported by an enhanced mobile network infrastructure. 

More mobile advertising networks are setting up in the UK, providing greater options to generate revenue from content.
