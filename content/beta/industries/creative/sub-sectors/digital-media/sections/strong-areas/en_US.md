**Creative disruption is driving digital advertising**

The size of the UK digital advertising market was £7.2 billion in 2014. Mobile advertising increased to £1.6 billion; that's up 63% on the year. 

Delivering targeted and effective advertising has also generated new business segments which are thriving here. That means many new opportunities for market entrants in areas such as  programmatic trading, native advertising and analytics.

**Personalisation is boosting mobile**

The UK is Europe’s largest mobile content market, with over £1 billion spent on mobile applications, content and services each year, and the highest mobile advertising spend per head.  Our e-commerce market was worth £104 billion in 2014. 

Mobile in the UK has been boosted by our strong leadership in personalisation of platforms and content, an increase in smartphones and choice of mobile contracts, and a strong games and advertising industry. This is all supported by an enhanced mobile network infrastructure. 

More mobile advertising networks are setting up in the UK, providing greater options to generate revenue from content.

Other growth opportunities include: 

- social media - Britons are amongst the biggest users of social networks in Europe
- digital radio and TV – the UK has one of the world’s largest digital radio networks, and 97% of UK homes have digital TV
- innovative tech in production and art – for example sensors and motion capture  in film
- digital music – accounted for 54% of all music consumption in 2015 

Our offer has ensured investment by some of the world’s biggest digital players including Google, Facebook and Amazon, as well as China’s Alibaba.

**Our talent and skills**

**A deep pool of skilled and creative talent**

With digital education now heavily emphasised from junior schools to postgraduate level,  we have the people you need to ensure your company’s long term growth.  

The UK has an educated and skilled digital workforce, operating in a highly competitive environment, which keeps them at the cutting edge.

Our universities are ranked second in the world for the quality of their industry collaboration and we have around 120,000 students studying digital media-related disciplines. Our college courses have a strong focus on skills which support interactive media, mobile and games development. The result is a deep talent pool, from software engineers and developers to animators and games designers.

Working from the UK means you’ll be operating within a  large research community and an ecosystem of partners, academic institutions and skilled workers. These networks mean smaller companies can easily work with and learn from each other, and collaborate with major firms too.

**London’s global status and our regional hotspots**

London has been rated top for technology readiness in a study of 30 of the world's most dynamic cities, and the best city in Europe for digital entrepreneurs.  

Tech City, in London’s East End, has grown to become a global centre for creative digital companies. Startups like adtech pioneers Unruly have scaled up globally from the capital. 

The North of England also has several centres of digital media excellence; Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Rotherham, Leeds, Hull, Sunderland and the Newcastle and Durham areas. Together they generated £9.9 billion GVA to the UK economy in 2014. The potential for growth is great, with a further £6 billion estimated by 2020.    

There are other clusters of digital talent across the UK, most notably in Brighton, Reading and Cambridge.
