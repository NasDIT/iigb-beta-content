## UK food and drink industry specialisms

### Free-from products in the UK
Free-from products are formulated to avoid having elements in them that provoke adverse symptoms. This enables consumers who are intolerant or allergic to gluten, dairy or nuts to buy a wider choice of products.

Around one-third of British consumers are buying and eating free-from food, of whom:
22% buy gluten-free products
19% buy dairy-free products
16% buy wheat-free and lactose-free products

Gluten-free baked goods make up the majority of the free-from category - the market for these products grew nearly 30% between 2013 and 2015, to 210 million GBP. In 2015, 12% of new food products launched in the UK claimed to be gluten-free.

Frozen free-from food products are now worth approximately 15 million GBP with frozen prepared ready meals contributing to just over 9 million GBP of the market value.

### Food and drink packaging 
The UK packaging industry is a large and developed sector with annual sales of £10.9 billion. Of this, £7.1 billion is used for food and drink. The majority of UK production is sold in the UK and a majority of UK sales are made in the UK.

There are 85,000 jobs in the packaging sector, representing 3% of UK manufacturing employment. 

Packaging in the UK helps supports the demand to reduce waste. The UK wastes just 3% of food, very low by international and historic standards. And over 67% of packaging in the UK is recycled, which is ahead of EU targets.

### Food-service and catering sector in the UK
The UK’s catering industry is worth an estimated 88 billion GBP - around 43% of total consumer spending on food and drink.

There were 453,000 registered restaurant and catering establishments in the UK in 2014 and the UK eating-out market was worth 33.5 billion GBP in 2014, according to Mintel.

Mintel estimated the UK fast food and takeaway market to be worth 9.4 billion GBP in 2014. The top four chains – McDonalds, Yum, Subway, and Dominos together had combined UK sales of 2.9 billion GBP in 2014. 

The UK pub industry had sales worth 23 billion GBP in 2015 and is forecast to grow by 9% to 25.5 billion GBP by 2020, according to Mintel.

Food sales are the fastest growing category in the pub market. Meals sold in pubs grew in value by 14% from 2012 to 2016 and sales of alcoholic drinks grew by 6% over the same period.

Mintel estimated the UK contract catering sector to be worth 3.8 billion GBP in 2014 and is forecast to grow to be almost 4.2 billion GBP by 2020.

### The UK’s pork, poultry and dairy supply chain
_Poultry_
There are opportunities in the poultry supply chain as the UK is currently a net importer of both chicken and eggs. 

Consumer spending on chicken is around 2.5 billion GBP.

The largest sector of imports, by both volume and value remains fresh/frozen whole chickens with a 50% value share and 53% by volume.

The UK egg market was valued at 965 million GBP in 2016-7 and has grown for the preceding 7 years. More than half of eggs sold were "free range". 

_Dairy products_
The UK is the third largest dairy producing country in the EU and the tenth largest producer in the world.

Dairy farming accounts for 17% of UK agricultural production and is the largest agricultural sector in the UK, employing over 80,000 people.

There are over 1.9 million cows in the UK, representing 8% of the EU dairy herd in 2016.

Export volumes are highest for milk and cream, accounting for around 73% of the exported dairy volume for within the EU and 66% outside of the EU.

Müller, a German dairy company, opened a 17 million GBP butter-making factory in Market Drayton in 2013. The dairy facility is the biggest of its kind in the UK, processing around 90,000 tonnes of cream about 45,000 tonnes of butter a year.

_Pork and pork products_
The UK has a low self-sufficiency index for pork and pork products, indicating both consumer demand and opportunity.

The UK imports almost 4 times as much pork and processed pork products as it exports, and will produce only 55.8% of the meat it needs to satisfy consumption.
